Hiring AI System: Our recruitment platform uses AI to screen resumes and conduct video interview analysis. The system automatically scores candidates 1-100 based on resume keywords, facial expressions during video interviews, and voice tone analysis. Candidates scoring below 75 are automatically rejected without human review. The AI also analyzes social media profiles and predicts cultural fit based on personality traits extracted from online behavior.
