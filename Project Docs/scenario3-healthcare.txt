Healthcare AI System: Our diagnostic AI analyzes patient medical records, lab results, and imaging data to recommend treatments. The system automatically flags high-risk patients and suggests medication changes without requiring doctor approval for low-risk cases. It processes genetic data and family medical history to predict future health conditions and shares insights with insurance partners for risk assessment.
